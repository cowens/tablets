Perl 6 Tablets
    These are the Perl 6 Tablets, an encyclopedia that stores every information
    about Perl 6 on a place where it can be found easily and quickly.
    It tries to take full advantage of the possibilities of hypertext and HTML.

    The main content is divided in 10 "Tablets":
    
       *  0 History
       *  1 Language Design
       *  2 Basic Syntax (Spaces, Comments, Literals, Quoting, Formatting)
       *  3 Variables (Sigils, Twigils, Assignment, Typing, Scopes)
       *  4 Operators (Comparison, Math, String, Logic, Metaops)
       *  5 IO (Command Line, Files, Sockets, Network, Misc.)
       *  6 Blocks (Conditions, Loops)
       *  7 Subroutines (Signatures, Modules)
       *  8 Objects (Classes, Roles)
       *  9 Regex (Rules, Grammars)
       * 10 Metaprogramming (Macros, DSL)

    It has 6 indexes:

       * A Intex (all syntax elements and used terms alphabetical order)
       * B Lookup (cheat sheets - syntax elements ordered by categories)
       * C Cookbook (chunks of native Perl 6 programs)
       * D Delta (what to be aware of when switching from Perl 5)
       * E Best of (Appetizer)
       * F Links
