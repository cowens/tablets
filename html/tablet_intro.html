  <h2>Perl 6 Intro Tablet</h2>

Overview - Chapter: 0:History, 1:Design, 2:Basics, 3:Var, 4:Op, 5:IO, 6:{}, 7:Sub, 8:OOP, 9:Rx, 10:Meta
Intro - Appendices: A:Index, B:Tables, C:Cook, D:Delta, E:Best of, F:Links

Paul Graham: There are some stunningly novel ideas in Perl, for example. Many are stunningly bad, but that's always true of ambitious efforts. At its current rate of mutation, God knows what Perl might evolve into in a hundred years.
Goal:

In good Perl tradition, this documentation wishes to be everything to everybody, even if its main purpose is to teach Perl 6 to the Perl 5 programmer. Therefore I create a sorted and complete list of all features and details with examples and short comments. Nevertheless i try to make it readable like a book and requiring as little previous knowledge as possible and explaining most things along the way, or at least explain it in the Index. A well-functioning mind and a grasp of some basic programming concepts should be therefore enough to learn perl 6 with these tablets. For an brief explanations and overviews from various points of view, there are several chapter in the appendix, that make it even more useful.
Name:

The emerald tablets contain wisdom, that can help you understand the whole creation, as these Perl 6 Tablets help you understanding Perl 6. They are also written in a way, that they can be read and understood in a helpful manner again and again, on various levels of consciousness. So we try to do with these docs. A table, a word included in the word tablet, is also something where you can find quickly specific things. And at last I had to prevent namespace collision with other tutorials.
Structure:

This wiki form is explicitly chosen, because hypertext is better for free learning. You can more easily follow your interest by clicking on links. (And this attempt is too big for one editor only, of course.) All content is sorted by topic into 9 chapters. Every chapter has also a fine grained structure, so that single items can be found quickly and linked to. They begin with the basics and climb slowly to more depth. So you can end when you have had enough, without missing the crucial things. You could also read them from top to bottom, one after the other, without having to look too much backwards and forwards. Having everything indexed and crosslinked helps you find what you are interested in.

Chapter 0 is here, 1 and 2 are more theoretical about the language, chapter 3 .. 9 are about the concrete syntax and appendix A is the Index, that contain all computer science terms, operators and keywords. Appendix B contains all tables like operator precedence, C is a "best of tour", some kind of appetizer for Perl 6. Appendix D is a kind of 'perldelta' and Appendix E contains links to additional Materials.
Motivation:

I started this here, because I believe in the ideas of Perl 6 and I wish wholeheartedly that our dream comes true. But on the other hand, I have my own project in perl 5 and like writing productive code much more. So I decided to be, as audrey puts it so funnily, an english hacker and help others to ease their way into the world of these glorious ideas.
History:

These tablets started as my initial effort to write German Perl 6 documentation. It's still maintained in the german Perl wiki. Ruins of my first attempt to translate this into English can still be excavated down under, but let's make it more official here.
