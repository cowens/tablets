<p><i>Paul Graham: There are some stunningly novel ideas in Perl, for example.
Many are stunningly bad, but that's always true of ambitious efforts.
At its current rate of mutation, God knows what Perl might evolve into in a hundred years.

<h3>Goal:</h3>

In good Perl tradition, this documentation wishes to be everything to everybody,
even if its main purpose is to teach Perl 6 to the Perl 5 programmer.
Therefore I create a sorted and complete list of all features and details with
examples and short comments. Nevertheless i try to make it readable like a book
and requiring as little previous knowledge as possible and explaining most things
along the way, or at least explain it in the Index. A well-functioning mind and
a grasp of some basic programming concepts should be therefore enough to learn
perl 6 with these tablets. For an brief explanations and overviews from various
points of view, there are several chapter in the appendix,
that make it even more useful.

<h3>Name:</h3>

The emerald tablets contain wisdom, that can help you understand the whole
creation, as these Perl 6 Tablets help you understanding Perl 6. They are also
written in a way, that they can be read and understood in a helpful manner again
and again, on various levels of consciousness. So we try to do with these docs.
A table, a word included in the word tablet, is also something where you can
find quickly specific things. And at last I had to prevent namespace collision
with other tutorials.

<h3>Structure:</h3>

This wiki form is explicitly chosen, because hypertext is better for free
learning. You can more easily follow your interest by clicking on links. (And
this attempt is too big for one editor only, of course.) All content is sorted
by topic into 9 chapters. Every chapter has also a fine grained structure, so
that single items can be found quickly and linked to. They begin with the basics
and climb slowly to more depth. So you can end when you have had enough, without
missing the crucial things. You could also read them from top to bottom, one
after the other, without having to look too much backwards and forwards. Having
everything indexed and crosslinked helps you find what you are interested in.
<br><br>
Chapter 0 is here, 1 and 2 are more theoretical about the language, chapter 3 ..
9 are about the concrete syntax and appendix A is the Index, that contain all
computer science terms, operators and keywords. Appendix B contains all tables
like operator precedence, C is a "best of tour", some kind of appetizer for Perl
6. Appendix D is a kind of 'perldelta' and Appendix E contains links to
additional Materials.

<h3>Motivation:</h3>

I started this here, because I believe in the ideas of Perl 6 and I wish
wholeheartedly that our dream comes true. But on the other hand, I have my own
project in perl 5 and like writing productive code much more. So I decided to
be, as audrey puts it so funnily, an english hacker and help others to ease
their way into the world of these glorious ideas.

<h3>History:</h3>

These tablets started as my initial effort to write German Perl 6 documentation.
It's still maintained in the german Perl wiki. Ruins of my first attempt to
translate this into English can still be excavated down under, but let's make it
more official here.
