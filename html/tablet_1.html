<p id='quote'>Larry Wall: You should not take this picture to mean that linguistics is the
opposite of common sense. But there are many computer scientists who have complained
that it should be more like engineering and less like an art. And I disagree,
but that's okay.</p>

<a name="Main Goal">
<a href="#top"><h3>Main Goal</h3></a>

Enjoy life and <b>enjoy the freedom of expressing yourself</b>. Which means: support
you as much as possible, and not force you in any way. Perl 6 tries to be even
better than Perl 5 as your humble servant for translating your thoughts into
executable code (if possible).

<a name="Strategy">
<a href="#top"><h3>Strategy</h3></a>

Every style and level of expertise has to be supported. And even more difficult:
all of them have to play together well. The default often imitates a natural
language (e.g., English). The following oft-repeated terms encapsulate
strategies and concepts for this.

<a name="Terms">
<a href="#top"><h3>Terms</h3></a>

<a name="TIMTOWTDI">
<a href="#top"><h4>TIMTOWTDI</h4></a>

Perl's everlasting slogan: "There is more then one way to do it," meaning your
way is valid, too. Just be aware of logical consequences.

<a name="Visual Metaphor">
<a href="#top"><h4>Visual Metaphor</h4></a>

People like to see their code as a picture at first glance. Therefore names and
operators should be distinctive, similar things should look similar, different
things different. Larry likes to add: weird things should also look weird. And
sometimes even characters can be ideograms; like the Z meta-operator, which
shows visually how it works (first left then right, then next left, etc.).

<a name="Topicalizer">
<a href="#top"><h4>Topicalizer</h4></a>

This also has to do with natural attention flow. If a topic or first word of a
sentence sets an understandable context for what follows, the meaning is built
up word for word. This is much easier to grasp, than if the last word of a block
resolves the block's entire meaning (like regex modifiers do in Perl 5). In
particular, for and given are called topicalizers, because they set $_, the
current topic variable.

<a name="Context sensitive">
<a href="#top"><h4>Context sensitive</h4></a>

The same term or symbol might do different things in different contexts,
although we have done our very best to consistently represent the same general
idea. Maybe the best example is the * aka Whatever. But every context is its own
domain, optimized to solve the problems of that domain.

<a name="Maximum reuse">
<a href="#top"><h4>Maximum reuse</h4></a>

Not only is syntax reused, to minimize the stuff you have to remember, but
concepts are reused also, wherever possible. For example, Pairs are used to
build hashes or named parameters in routines calls. There are plenty more
examples. Maybe the biggest one: the regex engine that parses your code is the
same engine you use in your program.

<a name="No special">
<a href="#top"><h4>No special rules</h4></a>

Most of the special rules that plagued Perl 5 are gone or generalized.

<a name="One pass">
<a href="#top"><h4>One pass parsing</h4></a>

Perl 6 is much easier to understand, both for people and also for software
parsers. The language is designed to be understood by machines in one read,
dividing the source in smaller and smaller units. As a nice side effect: syntax
errors can only damage the understanding of small units.

<a name="Keep easy">
<a href="#top"><h4>Keep easy things easy and hard things possible</h4></a>

Beside TIMTOWTDI, the other ancient slogan is "Make easy things easy and hard
things possible." Even if nearly every cool idea is crammed into Perl 6, we
don't lose track of the basics. Features are made as accessible and free of
artificial prerequisites as possible. For example, printing a variable as a line
without explicit quotes and newline (say $var), or reading a file without a file
handle (slurp("filename").lines). Rule of thumb: if you can think of a concept
as trivial, then it should be. On the other hand, if you can think of a
computable solution, it should at least be doable in Perl (no artificial walls).

<a name="Huffman coding">
<a href="#top"></h4>Huffman coding</h4></a>

This is a refinement of the last rule: common, often used things have short,
straightforward names. More verbose names indicate more rare, harder to grasp
concepts, or things that overwrite the default rules ("weird things should look
weird"). It also implies that the defaults lean toward what a beginner (non-Perl
5 programmer) might expect ("hide the fancy stuff").

<a name="Water bed">
<a href="#top"><h4>Water bed theory of linguistic complexity</h4></a>

This philosophy underlies the two previous terms. All Perl words should reflect
logical units which can be freely combined. Making it more complicated than
necessary is obviously not desirable. But oversimplification will create
artificial complexity somewhere else. Like a water bed, where you can press down
in one place but the water will go up in another.

<a name="All your">
<a href="#top"><h4>All your paradigms are belong to us</h4></a>

We learn, take and adapt from every source possible to offer the best of all
breeds. You should be able to keep your style when switching to Perl. Perl 6
supports the structured, object oriented, aspect oriented, functional, design by
contract, declarative and logic programming paradigms.

<a name="Buzzword compliant">
<a href="#top"><h4>Buzzword compliant</h4></a>

This term is an extension to the previous. Not only every programming paradigm,
but also every technique or neat trick loudly marketed out there as "must have"
"in the [%DATE%]", should be available in Perl 6 (or at least be possible), as
long there is expressive value in it. A few examples include "named parameters",
"lvalue subroutines", "parametizable subclasses" or "hygienic macros".

<a name="Second system">
<a href="#top"><h4>Second system syndrome</h4></a>

We are very aware that many ambitious software projects that are rebuilt from
scratch fail. Especially those which aim to be "even better in all ways"
successors of already successful creations. In fact, this happens so often that
the term "second system syndrome" was coined. We chose this path for Perl 6
anyways, because we believe it's the only way to get a significantly better
language. (Gradual improvements are flowing into Perl 5 all the time, sometimes
inspired from Perl 6.) That's why the unofficial motto of Perl 6 is "Second
system syndrome done right".

<a name="Trends">
<a href="#top"><h3>Trends</h3></a>

As a consequence of these principles, <a href="">various trends</a> can be observed.

 <a name="Design Process">
<a href="#top"><h3>Design Process</h3></a>

The initial source of the Perl 6 design came from 361 RFC (request for comments)
submissions by people from all over the world. Larry Wall sorted and commented
on them in several documents called the Apocalypses (meaning "revelations").
Damian Conway wrote, for each Apocalypse, an Exegesis ("explanation"), that
expounded Larry's ideas. These are now all historic documents that not have
changed since, because they were much harder to maintain than the Synopses
("abstracts" or "comparisons" (with Perl 5)). The Synopsis documents, along with
the test suite, form the official specification of Perl 6. More details on that
can be found in the history section.
<br><br>
The Synopses are continually edited because the more we think about the syntax
and semantics, the more detailed the picture gets. The other important input
comes from the implementors. They uncover cases that worked only in theory, and
important corner cases not thought about before. This mutual influence of
specification and implementation we call the whirlpool model of software
development, which is an intended pun on the well-known waterfall model.
<br><br>
Design changes are usually discussed in the p6l mailing list and the <a
href="irc://freenode/perl6">#perl6</a> channel on the freenode IRC network.
