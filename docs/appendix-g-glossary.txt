# A

*ALAP* - as late as possible, within a given execution phase
(compile time or run time)

*ASAP* - as soon as possible, within a given execution phase
(compile time or run time)

(#AST)
*AST* - (abstract syntax tree), tree like data structure, in which
source code is transformed, before running the programm


# B

*backtracking* - after a part of a pattern didn't match,
this last operation might not be counted (undone) and the pointer
for the position in the string where actual matching is taking place
is going a few steps to the left (it goes back)

*[binding](tablet-3-variables#binding)*
making two variables share the same content by pointing to same
memory location

(#block)
*block* - syntactically just a piece of code inside curly brackets
(**{}**), when [evaluated](#evaluation) it becomes an
object of the type **[Block](appendix-a-index.html#block-type)**

# C

*capture* -

*closure* -
routines whose state (content of all local variables) is
completely preserved until the next execution

*coderef* -
reference (pointer) to an executable block of code (routine)

*compilation* -
reading the human written source code and make it an
executable (piece of) program

*compile time* -
time when Perl converts source code to executable form (bytecode),
is always before *[runtime](appendix-a-index.html#runtime)*
even if code can be compiled via **[eval](appendix-a-index.html#eval)** and
**[evalfile](appendix-a-index.html#evalfile)** when the program is
already runnung, to run code at the begin of compile time use
**[BEGIN](appendix-a-index.html#begin-phaser)** and
**[CHECK](appendix-a-index.html#check-phaser)** to run at the end of
compile time for that unit (mostly the file or the to be **eval**ed string)

*context* -
when executing a function or operator Perl considers the
expression from which the call was to return a
[scalar](#scalar-type) or other kind of result

*context variable* -
name for **[$\_](appendix-a-index.html#context-var)**,
which is used by built in Perl functions as an implicit
parameter and as memory of the last result

*currying* -
creating a *[subroutine](routine)* that calls another with certain
*[parameter](#parameter)* to be predefined


# D

*declarative programming* - programming paradigm that expresses the
logic of a computation without describing its control flow

*design by contract* - programming style in which parameters and
return values from routines must meet conditions; A signature is
considered contract in Perl 6


# E

*evaluation* - executing a piece of program, before that all
variables will be replaced with their content

# F

*functional programming* - exclusively function based programming
style, [strongly
supported](ap-d-p5-p6-delta.html#functional-programming)
by Perl 6, considered as a branch of Declarative Programming


# G

# H

# I

*iteration* - flow control, repeatedly executing a block

# J

*junction* - a type of value that holds a logical combination of
several values, example: (A and B) or C

# K

# L

*list context* -

*longest token matching* - (short *LTM*) when searching a pattern
with alternatives (sub|substr) the search will continue after
finding the pattern 'sub' because of looking for the longest
alternative

# M

*[metaoperator](appendix-b-grouped.html#metaoperators)* - 
alters the meaning of other operators

*metaprogramming* -

# N

# O

*object oriented orogramming* - programming paradigm (style), that
arranges data and functions that belong together into so called
objects


# P

*parameter* - value passed to a method or *[subroutine](routine)*,
mostly as part of the signature

*parsetree* - hierarchical data representing the logical structure
of a program, also called *[AST](#ast)*

[phaser](appendix-b-grouped.html#closure-traits) -
Perl 6 term for specially named subblocks withe special runtimes
aka closure traits - example:
**[BEGIN](appendix-a-index.html#begin-phaser)**

*pipe* - connection between 2 processes, move data (mostly only in
one direction) without buffering

*[POD](tablet-2-basic-syntax.html#pod)*
Plain Old Documentation, a markup language to be embeded into
Perl source code, has in Perl 6 ability to store data to be
retrieved later

*pointy block* - a block that is given readonly *[parameters](parameter)* with
**[-\>](appendix-a-index.html#arrow-op)** or rw parameters with
**[<-\>](appendix-a-index.html#lower-minus-greater-op)**

*property* - metadata of a variable set at runtime

# Q

# R

*reference* -
address of data in memory, often termed a capture in Perl 6

*regular expression* - in Perl5: pattern matching notation, either
regex, token or rule in Perl6

*routine* -
block of code callable by name,
can have a *[signature](#signature)* and a return type,
objects of the type **[SoftRoutine](appendix-a-index.html#softroutine-type)**
and **[HardRoutine](appendix-a-index.html#hardroutine-type)**

*runtime* - time when execution hits a certain part of the program,
after *[compile time](#compile-time)*


# S

*scope* - the block of code within which an identifier is usable

*sigil* - character that serves as a prefix to categorize the
following name, most prominent in Perl are the variable
[sigils](appendix-b-grouped.html#sigils)
: **[$](appendix-a-index.html#dollar-sigil)**,
**[@](appendix-a-index.html#at-sigil)** and
**[%](appendix-a-index.html#percent-sigil)**

*signature* - function parameters (left-hand side of a binding),
surrounded by round parentheses

*slice* - part of an array or list

*slurpy array* -
array parameter that receives all (slurps) all optional
*[subroutine](routine)* arguments


# T

*topicalizer* -
every keyword that sets the **[$\_](appendix-a-index.html#context-var)**
variable, like *[given](appendix-a-index.html#given)*
and *[for](appendix-a-index.html#for)*

*trait* -
additional property of a variable, defined at compile time,
see **[but](appendix-a-index.html#but)**, what other languages call
*trait* Perl calls [role](#role)

*[twigil](appendix-b-grouped.html#twigils)*
second(ary) *[sigil](#sigil)* indicating a
special property of a variable


# U

# V

# W

# X

# Y

*[yadda operator](operators.html#yadda)* -
placeholder for later to be written code, because in empty
routines are forbidden, comes in 3 flavours:
**[...](appendix-a-index.html#triple-dot-yadda-op)**,
**[???](appendix-a-index.html#triple-question-mark)** and
**[!!!](appendix-a-index.html#triple-exclamation-mark)**


# Z
