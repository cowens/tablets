% Perl 6 Tablet 9 - Regexes

> "We put the 'Regular' back into 'Expression'." â€” Larry Wall

Like [quotes](basic-syntax.html#quoting), are Regular Expressions now
a sublanguage, a language inside the language, instead of being just
funny strings. They are parsed by a completely different set of rules,
which are stored in the special variable \$\~Regex (\$\~Trans for
transliterations and \$\~P5Regex for compatible Regexes). But these
rules are made much more consistant with the main language than
before.

Literal Character
=================

Every alphanumeric character has no special meaning and stand for the
character visible. If a backslash (\\) is standing directly in front
of the character it becomes a metacharacter. For not alphanumeric
chars the opposite is true. Inside of
[quotes](basic-syntax.html#quoting) every char is literal.
